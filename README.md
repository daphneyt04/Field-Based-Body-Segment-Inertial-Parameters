# Field-Based-Body-Segment-Inertial-Parameters
MATLAB scripts to calculate body segment inertial parameters
The project aims at utilizing photogrammetry and scanning techniques to estimate inertial parameters of body segments, such as mass and center of mass, through 2-D, 3-D, or LIDAR measurements. These measurements will be performed in the field before an athlete takes part in either training or a game. Our estimations will be validated through the compares to other state-of-the-art techniques. The estimated inertial parameters will be used to inform the inverse dynamics problem. 

We will processed and analyze data from an STL triangle mesh using MATLAB scripts found within this repository. These calculations can be utilized with biomechanical models for specific movement information and contribute to informing the inverse dynamics problems
